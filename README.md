# Harry Potter Trivia

Have you spent the better part of the last two decades immersed in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter? Do you dream of having an owl mail delivery service? Are you still waiting for your Hogwarts Letter to arrive? Then this trivia game is for you.

Create a username, select your house, and begin your adventure. But be careful, if you aren't as knowledgeable as you think, Voldemort will take control of the Wizarding World as we know it.

Each round you'll have 3 chances to answer at least 5 of 7 questions correctly. Should you successfully get through all 7 rounds, you will save the Wizarding World. Should you fail, Voldemort will prevail and we'll be stuck in some weird alternate Cursed Child reality. Good luck!
